## What is it?
FlightController orchestrates task execution (flight traffic) in a controlled manner within cloud environments. It takes user-defined tasks (flights to take off/landing traffic etc.) and sends for executions (let flights to take off/landing) whenever the specified concurrency limit (runway limit) permits. It can be helpful to perform a full scan of a NoSQL database table at a designated throughput, enabling offline jobs to be completed with calculated impact. For example, it can be used to calculate an e-commerce siteâ€™s daily SKUsâ€™ popularity rate based on todayâ€™s view impressions and their past 3-day popularity rate, or dump weekly snapshots to the data lake with on-the-fly data transformation.
## Implementation Notes
FlightController uses a user-defined inflight function to handle each received task. Users push tasks to a FlightController-hosted queue, which FlightController then polls periodically (based on a user-defined interval) when the counting semaphore indicates that task executors are available (according to user-defined max throughput).
